### What is the purpose of your app?
 To create a Pokédex which in terms of the Pokémon world is a mobile database lookup interface. It's for anyone who enjoys Pokémon and wants to look up information on one of them. 

### Focus on one main use case

The main use-case is looking up information on Pokémon.

### How will people use your app?

Players of Pokémon Go can easily figure out what’s missing from their in-game Pokédex by looking at this completed resource. The same players can also divise strategies for gyms since certain types/elements have advantages and disadvantages when matched with other Pokémon, i.e., paper beats rock. Some enthusiast enjoy looking at the Pokémon art as well.

### Concentrate on a few key features

A search function may be helpful, but not necessary. The app will only have the first 150 Pokémon hardcoded unless I use a public api which allows access to all of them. That includes various groups of information on each and an image. I will focus on just the names, images, and type as well as strength/weakness in “type”.

### Sketch out your app

### Required technologies

If hardcoded, the app would use SQL for data. Using an API: on android it would need a tool called Retrofit; as for iOS, I do not know but may search for it.

### Testing plan

I plan to run the apps on various devices if possible.
