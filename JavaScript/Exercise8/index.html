Click on the Miscellaneous link in the navigation panel, then click on the
Exercise 9 Files folder. Here you will find files called Exercise 9 Examples,
Saving the images, and nine image files.  The "Exercise 9 Examples" file are
screen captures of what the program should look like.  The "Saving the Images"
file are instructions on how to save the image files found in "Miscellaneous ->
Exercise 9 Files" folder for use on your web site.  Lastly, you'll find the 9
images used throughout the web site.

Create a web site called "The Computer Factory", it is only three pages.  The
first page is the home page (called index.html), just introduces the user to the
web site.  The second page (called Picture.html) shows the various computers
made by the Computer Factory.  Clicking the image will randomly change the
images.  Extra Credit:  get the previous and next buttons, on the second page,
to toggle through the images and earn 10 points on top of the Exercise category
of your grade.  The last page is the user information page, here you enter the
user information.

Using CSS, design a web page such as the one in the Exercise 9 Example.  The
entire screen's color is #005988, the header and footer color is #869dc7, the
navigation panel's color is #b3c7e6, the main web page area is #ffffff, and the
text box and buttons are #ffcccc.  There are white lines at the bottom of all
the navigation links.  All of the text colors are #00005d.  The header font
should be "Comic Sans MS", 40px, the navigation font size should be 12px, the
footer font size should be 10px, page 3 labels are 12px,  and the right column
is 10px.   Page 1 and page 2's image should be 350px by 450px big, and page 3's
images should be 200px by 300px.  The overall wrapper width should be 80% and
the navigation's width 20% centered.  The minimum width of the wrapper should be
800px.

Finally,  it should have the same look and feel from page to page.

There are four fields on this page: First name, Last name, Telephone, and Email.
You must set up event listeners for each of these fields.  The First Name and
Last Name listeners will both call the txtNameChange event handler.  When the
user changes the contents of these fields, the event handler will change the
first character to upper case and the rest of the characters to lower case.  If
the fields are changed to rOsAdO the handler converts it to Rosado.

The Telephone listener will call the txtPhoneChange event handler.  When the
user changes the contents of this field, the event handler does one of three
things: 1) Check to insure the number entered is a number.  If characters are
entered tell the user to only enter numbers and return to the Telephone fields
selecting the text.  2) Check that only nine numbers are entered. if more than
nine or less than nine are entered, tell the user to enter nine digits for area
code and phone number.  3) If nine digits are entered, then convert the number
to the following format: (203) 355-4444.  You must put the parenthesis before
and after the three digit area code followed by a space.  Then the three digit
prefix followed by a hyphen and then the last four digits of the phone number.
