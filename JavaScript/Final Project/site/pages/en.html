					The earliest form of English is called Old English or Anglo-Saxon (c. 550–1066 CE). Old English developed
					from a set of North Sea Germanic dialects originally spoken along the coasts of Frisia, Lower Saxony,
					Jutland, and Southern Sweden by Germanic tribes known as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. In the fifth
					century, the Anglo-Saxons settled Britain and the Romans withdrew from Britain. By the seventh century,
					the Germanic language of the Anglo-Saxons became dominant in Britain, replacing the languages of Roman
					Britain (43–409 CE): Common Brittonic, a Celtic language, and Latin, brought to Britain by the Roman
					occupation. England and English (originally Englaland and Englisc) are named after the Angles.
				</p>
				<p>
					Old English is very different from Modern English and difficult for 21st-century English speakers to
					understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern German, and its closest relative is Old Frisian.
					Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms, and word order was
					much freer than in Modern English. Modern English has case forms in pronouns (he, him, his) and a few
					verb endings (I have, he has), but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more
					person and number endings.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the period from the 8th to the 12th century, Old English gradually transformed through language
					contact into Middle English. Middle English is often arbitrarily defined as beginning with the conquest
					of England by William the Conqueror in 1066, but it developed further in the period from 1200–1450.
					The next period in the history of English was Early Modern English (1500–1700). Early Modern English was
					characterized by the Great Vowel Shift (1350–1700), inflectional simplification, and linguistic
					standardization. Literature from the Early Modern period includes the works of William Shakespeare and
					the translation of the Bible commissioned by King James I. Even after the vowel shift the language still
					sounded different from Modern English: for example, the consonant clusters /kn gn sw/ in knight, gnat,
					and sword were still pronounced. Many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of Shakespeare
					might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of Early Modern English.
